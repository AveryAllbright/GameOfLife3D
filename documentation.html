    <h1>The Game of Life 3D</h1>
    <h2>By Emily Irish Dixon (Emma Banks)</h2>
    
    <h3>Design</h3>
    <p>This project is technically a continuation of my Game of Life project from earlier in the semester: <a href="https://codepen.io/EmilyIrishDixon/pen/mGzBMq"> Game of Life on Codepen</a>. I wanted to port it to 3D; not just the project but the game itself. I also wanted to mute down the colours from the first version, and just stick with flat, pastel colours that worked well together.  </p>
    
    <h3>Development</h3>
    <p>Prior to diving in, I had to find rulesets that worked with the extra dimension. There were a few resources, but ultimately it was the included <a href="01-3-1.pdf">pdf</a> that gave me the most solid answers. From there, I played around with the size of the cube (though it wraps around) and how much to display. Then it was implementing THREE.js' post processing code, and adding the Glitch and afterimage effects. Finally I implemented dat.gui to give users a menu where they could play with the effects and lights, but more importantly the ruleset. I also added a custom slider for this version that allows users to play with their own rules. </p>
    
    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <p>The goal of 3D Life was just that. Make a working simulation of the game of life in 3D, and let users play with the rulesets for it. I wanted to create an interactive, cool looking, 3D version of a project I already really liked, and it turned out pretty nice.</p>
    
    <h3>Brief</h3>
    
    In the end, the post processing doesn't add a lot, and its sourced from THREE. I was hoping that implementing what I had would help inspire me to do more with the effects, but in the end, I had so much trouble getting it working that I didn't want to touch it. Which also meant it was staying in. Overall, I wanted to do this fun thing with Life, because it was my favourite project (RIP Asteroids), and I did. I think its pretty, anyway.
